# 1. Cosmetics Sales Management System
Folder: [`Cosmetics Sales Management System`](./Cosmetics%20Sales%20Management%20System)

A database project developed for the *Database Principles and Applications* course, implementing a **cosmetics sales management system**. This project demonstrates relational schema design, data normalisation, and key SQL functionalities such as views, stored procedures, triggers, and constraints.


## Project Overview
The system supports end-to-end management of cosmetics sales, including:

- **Product Management** – tracking product info, pricing, stock  
- **Supplier Management** – storing supplier details and contact info  
- **Customer Management** – storing customer info and purchase records  
- **Sales & Inventory Management** – tracking warehouse inventory, sales transactions, and stock movements  
- **Reporting & Analytics** – generating views and summaries of inventory and sales  

The system models real-world operations for a cosmetics retail company.



## Database Design

- **Entities**: Products, Suppliers, Customers, Salespersons, Inventory, Sales Transactions  
- **Relationships**: One-to-many between suppliers and products, customers and sales, products and inventory  
- **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints (e.g., valid price ranges), default values  
- **Views**: Provide summarised or filtered data for quick reporting  
- **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulate common queries, e.g., retrieve product stock, sales records  
- **Triggers**: Automated actions on data changes, such as logging or preventing invalid updates  

The database schema is normalised to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.


## Key Features

1. **Modular Design** – separates products, customers, suppliers, sales, and inventory  
2. **Data Integrity** – enforced through primary/foreign keys and constraints  
3. **Automation** – triggers provide automatic notifications or validations  
4. **Query Support** – supports complex multi-table queries for reporting and analysis  
5. **Extensibility** – schema and procedures designed to allow easy addition of new product lines, suppliers, or sales campaigns  


## Technologies Used

- **Database Engine**: Microsoft SQL Server  
- **SQL Concepts**: Tables, Relationships, Constraints, Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers  
- **Design Methodologies**: ER modelling, relational schema normalisation, multi-table joins  


## Usage

1. Open the provided database file in SQL Server Management Studio.  
2. Run initialisation scripts to create tables, relationships, and insert sample data.  
3. Use views and stored procedures to explore data and generate reports.  
4. Triggers demonstrate automated responses to changes in the database.  


## Notes
The main goal is to demonstrate robust database architecture, query design, and the use of advanced SQL features.

## 2. Train Ticket Booking Management System
Folder: [`Train Ticket Booking Management System`](./Train%20Ticket%20Booking%20Management%20System)

A database project designed to manage **train ticket reservations** and passenger information. It shares a similar structure and approach to the cosmetics project, focusing on backend functionality.

**Core Features:**
- Tracks train schedules, seat availability, and ticket bookings  
- Manages passenger data and ticket transactions  
- Supports complex queries and reporting  
- Implements constraints, views, stored procedures, and triggers  

**Technologies Used:** SQL Server, relational schema design, multi-table queries

**Highlights:**
- Relational design for trains, passengers, bookings, and schedules
- Use of constraints, views, and triggers to ensure data integrity
- Example stored procedures to query bookings by date or train



## 3. Clothing Sales Management System
Folder: [`Clothing Sales Management System`](./Clothing%20Sales%20Management%20System)

**Description:**  
A database project developed for the *Database Principles and Applications* course, implementing a **clothing sales management system**. This system manages inventory, suppliers, customers, sales, and warehouse operations for a clothing retail business.

**Core Functionalities:**
- **Product Management** – tracking clothing items, colours, categories, pricing, and stock  
- **Supplier Management** – managing supplier details and transactions  
- **Customer Management** – storing customer data and purchase history  
- **Sales & Inventory Management** – managing warehouse stock, sales orders, and inventory updates  
- **Reporting & Analytics** – generating views and summaries of stock levels and sales performance  

**Highlights:**
- Relational database design with normalised tables for products, suppliers, customers, salespersons, and inventory  
- Use of primary/foreign keys, check constraints, and default values to enforce data integrity  
- Views, stored procedures, and triggers to support automated reporting, notifications, and validations  
- Designed to model real-world operations of a clothing retail business
